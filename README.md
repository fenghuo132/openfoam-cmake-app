of-build
========
An example of how to use the CMake build system to develop extensions to OpenFOAM.

The 'helloFoam' example can be built following these steps

    cd helloFoam
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    make install

This is how a typical out-of-source is done using cmake.
